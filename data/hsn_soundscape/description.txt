<h2>High Sierras Soundscape Dataset</h2>
<p>
  This dataset is based on the soundscape recordings from the High Sierras dataset, provided by 
  <a href="https://github.com/DBD-research-group/BirdSet">BirdSet</a>.
</p>
<p>
  BirdSet offers 5-second segments extracted from the High Sierras soundscape. 
  The dataset consists 12,000 segments across 21 bird species.
</p>
<p>
  For digital signal processing, 
  <a href="https://pyfar.readthedocs.io/en/stable/pyfar.html">Pyfar</a> is used.

<h3>Polyphony Degree Selection</h3>
<p>
  A polyphony degree (up to 7) is selected pseudo-randomly from a predefined set. 
  Once chosen, the degree is removed from the set. When the set is empty, it is reset.
</p>

<h3>Raw Files</h3>
<p>
  Soundscape files with no annotated species tag are discared.
  No normalization is applied at this stage.
</p>

<h3>Mixing</h3>
<p>
  Each audio segment may include multiple species tags. While summing signals in the time domain, 
  species tags are accumulated. Mixing stops once the number of species tags equals or exceeds 
  the selected polyphony degree. The list of species tags may contain duplicates. This process repeats until all files have been used once.
</p>

<h3>Normalization</h3>
<p>
  The resulting mixed signal is normalized to full scale.
</p>

<h3>Annotations</h3>
<p>
  Each mixed signal is annotated with:
  <ul>
    <li>A polyphony map indicating the polyphony degree for each of the 21 species and the total polyphony degree</li>
    <li>A list of the raw audio files used</li>
    <li>A list of species tags included in the mix (may contain duplicates, reflecting the polyphony degree)</li>
  </ul>
</p>

<p>To enhance the listening experience raw audio files have been normalized for playback on this  site.</p>
