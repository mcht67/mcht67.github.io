<h2>High Sierras Xeno Canto Dataset</h2>
<p>
  This dataset is based on the Xeno-Canto subset of the High Sierras dataset, provided by 
  <a href="https://github.com/DBD-research-group/BirdSet">BirdSet</a>.
</p>
<p>
  The subset consists of 5,460 focal recordings across 21 bird species.
</p>
<p>
  For digital signal processing, 
  <a href="https://pyfar.readthedocs.io/en/stable/pyfar.html">Pyfar</a> is used.
</p>

<h3>Raw Files</h3>
<p>
  From each raw file, the first 5 seconds are extracted using only the first audio channel. 
  No normalization is applied at this stage.
</p>

<h3>Polyphony Degree Selection</h3>
<p>
  A polyphony degree (up to 7) is chosen pseudo-randomly from a predefined set. 
  Once a degree is selected, it is removed from the set. When the set is empty, it is reset.
</p>

<h3>Mixing</h3>
<p>
  Audio signals are summed in the time domain until the number of tracks equals the selected polyphony degree. This process gets repeated until all files have been used once.
</p>

<h3>Normalization</h3>
<p>
  The mixed signal is normalized to full scale.
</p>

<h3>Annotations</h3>
<p>
  Each mixed signal is annotated with:
  <ul>
    <li>A polyphony map showing the number of contributing files for each of the 21 species and totale polyphony degree</li>
    <li>A list of the raw audio files used</li>
    <li>A list of species tags included in the mix (may contain duplicates, reflecting the polyphony degree)</li>
  </ul>
</p>


<p>To enhance the listening experience raw audio files have been normalized for playback on this  site.</p>
